I chose this dataset with an e-commerce venture I'd had in mind for some time now. Using MySQL- I was able to identify info on key sales info. The include: product SKU sales, sales by the various categories, size, time frames, etc. The idea is to use these findings to make the necessary adjustments to optimize (or enhance) the current process.
